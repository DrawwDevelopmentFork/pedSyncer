# pedSyncer

This AltV-resource is an experiment for synchronize peds. I publish this resource to give an idea how this can work. Furthermore, I also published it to allow contribution by other developers to improve this experiment. Maybe the developers of AltV themself can get an idea about how to implement this nice feature for the multiplayer-mod.

So, contribution is contribution is welcome!

# Disclaimer

This experiment is free to use. If you find any possibilities for improvements, please tell me or contribute by pull requests. It would improve this experiment and give a better idea about how this can work - so it could also a better idea for the AltV-Devs themself. If you find any issues please post them here.

As mentioned, this is just an experiment. For now I give no guarantee that it works. I do not recommend to use it on live-projects, because it is not tested to a big amount of players. If you want to test it, do it and tell me your feedback.

# Idea

Before you use or analyze this project I want to tell you the idea of the pedSyncer.
